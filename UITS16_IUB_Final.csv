That is, Courseload is offered as an eTextbook reader solution at IU - and student access is only offered if an eText is purchased through the Courseload model. While this is one use case, it diminishes the broader value of Courseload as a study and content-specific collaboration tool.  Meaning, Courseload is now part of the Unizin partnership and offered to all participating institutions.  We should have access to Courseload as a study tool as a student option in every class as it is integrated with the Canvas system and provides a single platform to read, annotate, and collaborate at the content level (.pdf, eText, faculty generated, publisher, and OER).  I think there is great academic value in pursuing an enterprise application of the Courseload tool such that students can use it in classes that do not require eTexts. As a doctoral student, all of my assigned readings are .pdf and I have to use a third party digital content reader, annotation, and markup tool that is not integrated with Canvas, let alone at the course level.  I cannot track or tag at the course, discipline, topic, etc. level.I'm happy to discuss the use case and the academic return on enterprise-level access to Courseload.  BTW, so very happy with the access UITS software as it has allowed me to explore and sharpen my knowledge with specific learning technologies.  And, the access to Lynda.com is invaluable.  What would be a big help is if you could reestablish the UITS Software link in Canvas.  It used to be in the Oncourse LMS and was very helpful.John Falchijfalchi@iu.edu919.656.0343Yeshiva UniversityInstructional Systems Consultant",9995,9995,9995,9995,Windows,IE,3/3/16 10:09,Windows,IE,3/3/16 10:31,2,22.47,151351,,4,,,,,,1.2,3/3/16 10:09,0

Exchange has been a mess for months now: hopefully there is an end in sight. Enough said.2. I'm increasingly concerned about the lack of FERPA-compliant online storage, particularly as it relates to the transmission of critical data. Despite the continuing push towards paperless offices, there is a lot of internal confusion amongst departments and administration in general regarding how to digitally distribute applications and other materials to the appropriate review boards. This is especially problematic in instances where open-ended questions allow for the insertion of critical data in a document which would otherwise be considered restricted.Adding to the confusion are outdated or inaccurate reference documents. Until very recently, Data Management's ""Classifications of Institutional Data"" page was self-contradictory, indicating (for instance) that student country of birth and citizenship data were both critical and restricted.These types of confusion have caused an endemic problem where various departments are using various inadequate solutions and burying their heads in the sand when it comes to FERPA-related concerns. Most alarmingly, upper-level administration seems just as confused as we are.These concerns show up in other areas as well: for instance, our scans have to be emailed to us from our network printer, and because our building has no phone lines, faxes are similarly emailed to us. Strictly speaking, that should make it impossible to fax or scan critical material: however, we are offered no alternate solutions for those situations which require faxing and scanning.",1,ebweinga@indiana.edu,9999,0,Windows,Firefox,2/5/16 11:39,Windows,Firefox,2/5/16 12:31,1,51.8,151351,63,2,Support,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES MAJOR,1,Full-time,,1.1,2/5/16 12:29,0

Printing. I understand that the massive scale of printing that UITS deals with creates challenges, and I usually am able to get my printing done. But I have noticed a dramatic increase in the number of unresponsive printers since the new id swipe system was installed. The first several weeks were to be expected with a new system, but it has been frustrating for me and my students that it has not been more consistently ironed out even up to this point. I also wonder about the durability of the touch screens--responsiveness already seems to be fading on some of the machines I use most in the Wells library and Kelley school.2. Loss of wireless signal is an absolutely critical failure in the classroom. Already this semester I have had three in-class exercises killed or severely reduced (as students switched to their phones using their individual data plans) due to limited or no access to IU Secure. We're in a newly renovated section of Hodge Hall, so I would expect the hardware to be some of the most up-to-date on the campus.

For example, Cloud space is harder to handle with Box since there are no easy sync clients for Linux on the market. There is less software for Linux, although it could be made available. For example SoftMakers Office 2016 is an excellent package for Linux, far better than LibreOffice, and it can be licensed for free from SoftMaker, with a campus license. This should be done and offered via IUWare. There are many useful packages for Linux users (Debian or Fedora) that could be integrated there, e.g. RStudio, Xmind, and so on, education versions of IDEs for all platforms, including Linux, that beat common traditional ones like CLion, PyCharm, WebStorm etc. We can get student and teacher licenses for free from JetBrains on their site. We should inform students and teachers about that, or alternatively make arrangements with them to cover students and faculty campus wide directly.Karst Desktop should also be promoted much better. This is such a valuable concept and piece of infrastructure, and too few know or care.I would enhance the connectivity and embedding in modern ubiquitous computing infrastructure, promote the use of iCal and vCard, to improve the communication and event management on campus. Obviously units need help with that. Most people I talk to have little or no knowledge of virtual calendars and management of those using mobile devices etc. We miss events because those get send to lists or individuals buried in email attachments of the type Word document or PDF.I would like to see some service offered to all of us like Overleaf that allows for easy collaborative and synchronous web-based LaTeX-editing. We use that a lot, but we pay private membership or use the limited open free version. Overleaf is much better than most other services. There is in fact more need for technology that would allow us collaborative work on documents ala Office 365 (that is also compatible with Linux browsers, Firefox or Chrome), or Google Drive.We are desperately missing a good collaborative coding environment of a similar type like Overleaf, Office 365 or Google Drive, something that would allow us to program and code algorithms with a wolf pack, class, colleagues from all over the planet, and maybe experiment directly on Karst or other infrastructure. IU could set up such an environment itself. It should not be too time consuming to do so, technically. There are many ready solutions that would need minor adaptation to enable that. A playground for iPython (with support for other languages as well) that could be used for teaching, presentation and research, would be also very useful. Some environment that would serve those interactive coding and documentation packages.Some of that might already exist and I might simply not be informed well enough. If the latter is the case, I would be happy to become better informed.Otherwise, I do really thing that UITS does an exceptionally good job.",0,9997,9997,9997,Other,Firefox,2/24/16 13:59,Other,Firefox,2/24/16 14:28,1,29.05,151351,78,1,Scientist/Scholar,LINGUISTICS,3,Full Time,No,1.1,2/24/16 14:27,0

I feel there is a STRONG need for this issue to be fixed. There needs to be a system set up were you are notified when the printer/copier is running low on paper. Whether that be, when there is only 1 tray of paper left or if the printer/copier notifies you that it is only 25% fully. You might also think of having an employee be in charge of stocking paper. That is there daily job. Stocking printer/copies with paper. It is frustrating, telling people that the printer/copier is out of paper, and that UTIS has been notify. Sometimes UTIS comes right away other times it can be hours. Also, when calling UTIS about other problems regarding the printer, we are not taken seriously. They will say to just turn the copier/printer off and then back on. This does not really solve the problem. It may help for a day, but then that same problem comes back. When people call regarding a problem, a specialist should come look at the printer/copier. Thanks!",0,9997,9997,9997,Windows,Chrome,2/1/16 11:07,Windows,Chrome,2/1/16 11:19,1,11.65,151351,134,2,Support,RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS & SERV,0,Full-time,,1.1,2/1/16 11:19,0

This helps a lot in staying organized, and even though the new Canvas UI looks great, I hate that it alphabetizes my courses and gives me no option(s) to hide completed classes or discussion/lab sections for a particular class wherein the instructor may not publish both sections. It just clogs up menus/dashboards and makes locating information difficult. ** Box: I love having Box available as a storage option, but the fact that I can't organize my files is a huge pain. Between files/folders from my previous position, my current position, and my student files/information, everything is a giant mish-mash. I normally would drag into folders to organize things, but if I'm not the folder owner I am unable to do that. I checked KB and the published user guides, but couldn't find a solution for this. **Printing: Despite using the Knowledge Base and having spent more than two years both as a full-time staff and a student, I still find it nearly impossible to utilize on-campus printers. When I had an office, it wasn't a problem, but now that I'm a full-time student and my staff position is ""remote"", I generally just try to print at home. I don't have any networked drives any more, and even though I've tried to figure out how to send something to a network print release station without having to go to a lab or log in to the kiosk, I still can't get it to work.I haven't yet had a chance to try to get assistance at the Help Desk for any of these yet. I may do that at some point for printing, but I think it would be helpful if there were some more user-friendly instructions for sending jobs to a print station (or, if they already exist somewhere, to create additional hotlinks... even if I know the building code, how could I possibly know which printer is 002 versus 006 in the same building?). As for Box and Canvas, I assume that's just some user feedback and perhaps it could be communicated to the developer(s).",0,9997,9997,9997,Windows,Chrome,2/24/16 20:31,Windows,Chrome,2/24/16 20:49,1,18.27,151351,,3,,,,,,1.1,2/24/16 20:49,0

At the same time, as the director of two pre-college music programs who at certain times of the yr. received 40+ emails a day from clients, I must have my computer and email program working correctly and efficiently to do my job well.  Trouble-shooting does not come naturally to me, so I am very dependent on UITS.   I am admittedly not an ""easy case"" to deal with--sometimes I don't even know what my UITS 'advisor' is talking about. :-)  For that reason I usually hand over control of my computer to the UITS advisor ASAP and let him/her trouble-shoot and try to fix the problem.      My experience with UITS and Music IT consultant has been very mixed, both from the standpoint of their ability to solve my problems and their manner when interacting with a ""novice""-level user like myself.  I have found their knowledge and diagnostic skills to be highly variable  I've received excellent help from some, well-intentioned advice that just didn't solve the problem from others, and totally wrong diagnoses from a few.     I want to single out Neha Martin at Music-IT services as an outstanding consultant--always receptive and extremely knowledgeable.  I have never thrown a problem at her that she couldn't solve quickly and well.  However I do most of my admin. work at home on my desktop computer (a Dell XPS) and cannot ask her to fix issues with the home computer.  Actually, the Dell has had almost no issues--but I have had a handful of exasperating problems with connectivity, esp. problems with Vpn and Pulse Secure. Once this yr. I suddenly couldn't send/receive email because the ""system"" out of the blue didn't recognize my credentials.  It took 2 of your advisors at UITS Support Center to resolve that.  The first didn't have a clue.  After trying various things, he told me I needed to upgrade to Outlook 2013....which wasted about 3 hrs. and didn't solve the problem.  Subsequently I received excellent assistance on the same issue from a young lady at UITS, who not only solved the problem, but explained to me in layman's language what she was doing.     I have one recommendation:  it would be so helpful if you had a way to connect users with the SAME consultant they were working with previously when they have to disconnect out of courtesy to allow a lengthy upgrade or something of that sort.  Yes, I know your consultants make notes for their successors.... but it's still irritating to have to start all over explaining what's wrong and what's been tried thus far.",9995,9995,9995,9995,Windows,IE,2/16/16 12:40,Windows,IE,2/17/16 13:49,3,1508.35,151351,83,1,Part-time Faculty,JACOBS SCHOOL OF MUSIC,24,Full Time,No,1.2,2/16/16 12:40,0

Plus Canvas feature request seem to be prioritized at a university wide level. As a result, the learning experience for students has suffered alot. I know of many students who have complained again and again about Canvas. Canvas support is good to say the least. Canvas discussions for example have a performance issue when there are too many discussions. You always seem to get lost in the system and have to go back to the home page to go to a new page. Usability of Canvas is EXTREMELY POOR. I also worry about accessibility issues. Also, Canvas email seems to be very unreliable. An email sent to students arrive later than expected. Email interface is terrible. Overall, Canvas is a bad design with a technology that is bloated with features that are not useful.

It is very difficult to connect to Internet sometimes and this problem does not happen due to the usage of a specific brand device. I carry laptops, tablets, cell phones, and phablets from three different brands and all of them seemed to have a hard time to connect to IU Secure when at the lowest level of certain buildings. Living in dorms freshman year, I never faced a problem connecting to IU Secure. Even at the lowest level or ground floor of the dorm would have strong wi-fi connection. Another problem I faced throughout my years here was that sometimes at a lab center, there would be an empty computer with no user, but an account that is logged in for a long period of time. Is there a specific duration to how long the period would be if someone locked the account and left the computer?Another issue",9995,9995,9995,9995,Windows,Chrome,2/24/16 16:47,Windows,Chrome,2/24/16 17:01,1,14.18,151351,,3,,,,,,1.2,2/24/16 16:47,0

It has started to work better this semester, but it was very difficult to use for the first year.  I would also like to see IU start to move away from PeopleSoft towards a more user-friendly interface for administrative functions.I also find the ""Big Brother"" monitoring to be very disconcerting.  I understand that there are security protocols and terms of agreement for using IU network resources, but I don't appreciate getting emails that accuse me of violating one protocol or another (for example, leaving a machine without logging out, or sharing my passphrase) without any sort of proof.

This is disruptive at best and less secure at worst. Friends and colleagues have reported the same problems, but none of us know why. It doesn't have to do with inactivity, as it happens in the midst of active sessions.It would be helpful if there were a log of trouble tickets submitted so that we could log in to see the status. Sometimes it's hard to know whether a request is just taking longer or whether it's falling through the cracks.Exchange and Outlook email have been increasingly problematic to use since the last update several months ago. The search features no longer work reliably or predictably (even known messages cannot always be located). Nested messages sometimes appear in conversations without notification, meaning that communications are missed. Messages sometimes arrive out of order. Also, the Outlook connectivity when working from my desktop in my office is completely unpredictable. It's very common to lose connection in the midst of writing a message, which either causes the message to be lost or necessitates copying and pasting it to another program like Word or Notepad while Outlook is restarted. There are days when email seems nearly unusable, which is very detrimental to our operations.",1,sgodby@indiana.edu,9999,1,Windows,Firefox,2/15/16 11:33,Windows,Firefox,2/15/16 11:45,1,11.93,151351,,4,,,,,,1.1,2/15/16 11:44,0

What has bothered me most in my time at IU is the Student Center and software for searching/registering for classes. It's the worst system I've seen at any university or community college. The functionality is not great- it is difficult to locate information (like course descriptions or descriptive titles), it's very difficult to quickly look at courses in unfamiliar departments (do you know the departmental code for other disciplines? If not, you're out of luck), and even the look and feel is poorly developed: tiny fonts, weird spacing, non-standard layout. With so many institutions having software that is both functional and user-friendly, it seems it would be easy to correct this problem with just a little research into alternative programs. If you look at the ratings on One.iu.edu for this system, you'll see it is universally despised and should be a priority. Oncourse was perfectly function and easy to understand- there is no way that phasing out Oncourse should have taken priority over the Student Center/course registration site.Another problem is specific to the library: the OneSearch tool is not very helpful. I'm not sure how its search functions differ from other similar programs, but it seems to struggle with multiple keywords, which is a pretty basic need for searches. I don't see much coordination between OneSearch and IUCat, so I feel like I lose a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to search for something.Last, IU Secure is touchy about connecting to smartphones. I've heard other students share the same experience, on different phones with differing OS. I don't have problems connecting my laptop or tablet, just the smartphone. Cell service on campus varies quite a bit, so wifi access is pretty important.All of these items are things I've discussed with other students (graduate and undergraduate both), and I have not found other students who were satisfied with them. It would be nice to have more transparency on UITS priorities, and perhaps campus input. I think many students would encourage time and energy to go toward improving the Student Center and course search/registration programs instead of launching one.iu.edu and launching Canvas. OneStart worked just fine, as did Oncourse, so for many of us, it's really unclear as to why those functional systems were phased out when there are other barely-functional systems that NEED to be improved or replaced and which don't seem to be any sort of priority.",0,9997,9997,9997,Windows,Firefox,1/28/16 23:11,Windows,Firefox,1/28/16 23:28,1,16.53,151351,,4,,,,,,1.1,1/28/16 23:28,0
