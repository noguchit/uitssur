- The front line staff of help desk and the web services department is always helpful. However, lab consultants quality varies. Some are very energetic and want to help people, some of them just don't show interest in offering help.

- next.iu.edu provides good information on what product is forthcoming or in testing. Would like to have those information being push to us, instead of need to go find out myself. Also, some of the product maybe of interest for us, e.g. soft chalk, but it is only available to IUB.

I have no reason to anticipate that Canvas will be any better than OnCourse, and by the time I learn Canvas, it will probably be replaced by something else. Most of the campus computer labs for students have been closed and not replaced, which creates a real problem for students, especially since the ""print to any print station from your phone or other mobile device"" apparently either does not work or screws up in unpredictable ways at least as often as it works. 

And more than anything else - PLEASE talk to the faculty who actually use the classrooms before changing the classroom technology (I absolutely hate the current ""tech lecterns"", which have zero surface space for notes, demo materials, etc, block the students' view of the chalkboard and/or of the professor with a monitor than can't be moved, and with dismaying frequency refuses to operate some crucial piece of equipment such as the LCD projector or the document camera). I do not have a single colleague who was aware of that change until they walked into their classrooms on the first day of class, and none of them are happy about it. Forcing us to give up valuable bench space in teaching labs to laptops that are locked in place and can't be moved in order to be able to show diagrams or figures is also increedibly frustrating.

Please train support staff to support more than one system. Last summer my phone stopped working (logged out spontaneously and refused to let me log back in); I put up with not having a phone in my office for several weeks and tried everything I could think of before asking my campus IT HelpDesk for assistance, because (as I'd anticipated) what I got when I did ask for help was ""Oh, you have a Mac - that's why your phone doesn't work. If you want a phone, you'll have to switch to a PC"" (ignoring the fact that I'd had a functioning phone with a Mac for several months if not years previously). I get this all the time - ""You can't do that"" rather than ""I/we don't know how to do that""....which would be less frustrating if it weren't for the fact that as mere faculty I'm not allowed administrative access to my own computer, so even if I *can* figure out how to solve a problem, I don't have the authority to change what needs to be changed in order to fix it. That policy, that only IT is ever allowed to change anything on individual faculty office machines, could be rescinded any time now.

And since I mentioned the phone system....has anybody considered the fact that now that the phones run through the computer system, every time the power goes out the phone system goes down? Which means I can't call out AND I can't get any IU Notify alerts telling me what's going on? I have to rely on random students in the hall getting messages on their smartphones and sharing those messages with me to find out if this is just a temporary issue or if my class has been cancelled. The assumption that everyone is permanently hardwired to the internet via mobile devices that always work (my whole floor of my building has no cell service, and the never-very-reliable wi-fi goes out when the power does) is simply not valid, and putting systems in place that rely on my ability to access e-mail and/or text messages in my office or in my building's basement during a tornado, for example, strikes me as not a good idea.",0,"9997","9997",,"Macintosh","Firefox",1/28/2016 16:22:03,"Macintosh","Firefox",1/28/2016 16:49:51,2,27.7,151342,219,1,"","","","","",1.1,1/28/2016 16:49:45,0

2) The WCMS is horrible!  It is difficult to use, cumbersome, and limited.  Because of that, many departments don't update their pages or if they do, they are unattractive and uninviting. There should be a folder that includes templates, buttons, rules, etc. that can easily be grabbed and adapted.  There is insufficient staff on campus to help with webpages or do training.  Even some of the local UITS pages have times included bad links, dated info, etc. 
3) I think specialized labs should supported and upgraded by UITS. 
4) Crimson is awful.
5) Students and community patrons need better mechanisms for adding money to their ids to print. 
6) Staff have not embraced Sharepoint because it is not intuitive or attractive.  I wish there was a better intranet platform.
